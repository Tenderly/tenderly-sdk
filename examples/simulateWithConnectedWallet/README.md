# Vite + React 18 + TS + TailwindCSS + ESLint

This is a starter template for React (TypeScript) using Vite. I've also added TailwindCSS so you can style your app without writing CSS code, and ESLint to analyze your code and suggest some optimizations.

You can find more about these technologies in the following links: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Eslint](https://eslint.org/).

## How to install

Just run the next command in a terminal (make sure that you have installed NPM).

```
npx degit dserranoc/vite-reactts18-eslint-tailwindcss project-name
```

## How to start

After the installation of the dependencies run:

```
npm run dev
```
